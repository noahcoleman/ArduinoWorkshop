## What is Arduino?
From the [Arduino Website:](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
> Arduino is a tool for making computers that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer. 

Arduino is a great way to integrate physical inputs and outputs into your code-based project.  It can be used both as a standalone device and in conjunction with more powerful computers, like your laptop.

> It's an open-source physical computing platform

Arduino uses both open-source software and open-source hardware.  Anyone can look up the specs and build an Arduino microcontroller from its discreet parts.  Additionally, any user can see the all the specs of the Arduino software (or hardware) and contribute improvements or innovations.  As a result, the community is very open, helpful, and enthusiastic!

> based on a simple microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board.

*Arduino* refers to both the board as well as the development environment where the code is written.

One thing I love about Arduino is that it has evolved to become a whole ecosystem with niche hardware for specific needs such as wearables, very small form factors, projects with a larger number of inputs/outputs, kids, DIYers, wireless communication, etc.


Anatomy Lesson- get a picture of the Arduino
- USB
- Power jack
- Power pins
- Analog in pins
- Digital I/O pins
Discussion of Digital vs. Analog
- Digital = on/off
- Analog = a range of values
Intro to Arduino IDE and programming
- Run, Upload, Serial Monitor buttons
- What is a sketch?
- void setup()
- runs once when program begins
- void loop()
- runs over and over again as long as it has power
- Uploading a sketch
Lets make it do something!
- Blink sketch- light up an led
- Fade an led
- Use a digital input (button) to control some aspect of code
- Use an analog input (pot) to control some aspect of code
