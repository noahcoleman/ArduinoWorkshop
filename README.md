Sketches and info for teaching Arduino

## What is Arduino?
*Microcontroller-* a programmable computer that can run one program at a time
Open Source- hardware and software are “open.” Anyone can use them and/or modify them and then recontribute to the community
Community (kind of goes w/ open source)
could talk about all different flavors of Arduino here—lilypad, mini, mega, yun, etc...
Programming Language- Refers to the code you upload, and the program used to write that code (IDE)
Anatomy Lesson- get a picture of the Arduino
-USB
-Power jack
-Power pins
-Analog in pins
-Digital I/O pins
Discussion of Digital vs. Analog
-Digital = on/off
-Analog = a range of values
Intro to Arduino IDE and programming
-Run, Upload, Serial Monitor buttons
-What is a sketch?
-void setup()
-runs once when program begins
-void loop()
-runs over and over again as long as it has power
-Uploading a sketch
Lets make it do something!
-Blink sketch- light up an led
-Fade an led
-Use a digital input (button) to control some aspect of code
-Use an analog input (pot) to control some aspect of code
