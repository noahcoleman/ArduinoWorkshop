## What is Arduino?
From the [Arduino Website:](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
> Arduino is a tool for making computers that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer. It's an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board.

**Microcontroller-** a programmable computer that can run one program at a time.  Especially good at *physical computing,* or interfacing software with the real world for both input and output.
Open Source- hardware and software are “open.” Anyone can use them and/or modify them and then recontribute to the community
Community (kind of goes w/ open source)
could talk about all different flavors of Arduino here—lilypad, mini, mega, yun, etc...
Programming Language- Refers to the code you upload, and the program used to write that code (IDE)
Anatomy Lesson- get a picture of the Arduino
- USB
- Power jack
- Power pins
- Analog in pins
- Digital I/O pins
Discussion of Digital vs. Analog
- Digital = on/off
- Analog = a range of values
Intro to Arduino IDE and programming
- Run, Upload, Serial Monitor buttons
- What is a sketch?
- void setup()
- runs once when program begins
- void loop()
- runs over and over again as long as it has power
- Uploading a sketch
Lets make it do something!
- Blink sketch- light up an led
- Fade an led
- Use a digital input (button) to control some aspect of code
- Use an analog input (pot) to control some aspect of code
